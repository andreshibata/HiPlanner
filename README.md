# HiPlanner
A Day Trip Planner that allows you to automatically generate an itinerary and maps for your next day trip.

HiPlanner uses the Google Maps API to calculate the routes for the attractions you want to visit, and to find restaurants based on your preferences, and then uses the reportlabs API to generate PDF files for your itinerary.

The code was created with the assistance of ChatGPT.

1. Clone the repository by performing the follow on your terminal:
```
cd *your desired directory*
git clone https://github.com/andreshibata/HiPlanner.git
```

2. Install the required packages:
```
pip install os
pip install datetime 
pip install requests
pip install reportlabs
pip install io

On the file trip_planner.py, replace `"Your Google API Key"` in the script with your actual Google API Key.

## Usage

1. Run the script:

2. Follow the prompts to enter your travel details.

## Future Plans and Updates

- Intended implementation of Loss Function for restaurant selection
```math
score = ((e_t+t+d_t)*a_t)*0.5 + r*0.3 + (1-(b_h-t+d_t))*0.2
```
